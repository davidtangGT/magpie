class LocalPropertyDifferenceAttributeGenerator:
    """
    Class to compute attributes based on the difference in elemental
    properties between neighboring atoms. For an atom, its "local property
    difference" is computed by:

    sum_n f_n * |p_atom - p_n| / sum_n f_n

    where f_n is the area of the face associated with neighbor n,
    p_atom the the elemental property of the central atom, and
    p_n is the elemental property of the neighbor atom.

    For shells past the 1st nearest neighbor shell, the neighbors are
    identified by finding all of the unique faces on the outside of the
    polyhedron formed by the previous neighbor shell. This list of faces
    will faces corresponding to all of the atoms in the desired shell and the
    total weight for each atom is defined by the total area of the faces
    corresponding to that atom (there may be more than one).

    By default, this class considers the only the 1st nearest neighbor shell.

    This parameter is computed for all elemental properties stored in
    Composition Entry ElementalProperties.
