    Class to compute attributes based on packing efficiency. Packing
    efficiency is determined by finding the largest sphere that would fit
    inside each Voronoi cell and comparing the volume of that sphere to the
    volume of the cell.

    For now, the only attribute computed by this generator is the maximum
    packing efficiency for the entire cell. This is computed by summing the
    total volume of all spheres in all cells, and dividing by the volume of
    the unit cell.
