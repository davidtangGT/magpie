    Class that uses the partial radial distribution function to perform
    regression. Each material is represented by a matrix containing the PRDF
    between each element type. Distance between structures are computed as
    Frobenius norm of the difference between their PRDF matrices. If you use
    this method, please cite Schutt, Glawe, et al. PRB (2015)
