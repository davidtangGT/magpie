<h3>Python version of <a target="_blank" href="http://oqmd.org/static/analysis/magpie/doc/index.html">Magpie</a> attribute generators</h3>
<hr>
<p>Magpie is an open-source software written in java for applying machine learning to predict properties of materials. It is being developed and maintained as part of the Open Quantum Materials Database (<a target="_blank" href="http://oqmd.org">OQMD</a>) at the Wolverton group in Northwestern University. Since a python version of it was useful for my research, I decided to convert all the attribute generator classes and related helper classes from java. I think this could be a useful tool for materials researchers as it provides easier access to the plethora of machine learning libraries written in python.</p>
